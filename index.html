        <p>The difference is in the results.
        
        There are many reasons UTBRS should be your agency of choice. Our outstanding customer services sets us apart from our
        competitors.
        
        We are not going to accept your accounts and then disappear. Our client relations team will be there for you no matter
        how small the problem. We are determined to keep a professional and congenial relationship with your staff. You won't
        need to call and leave messages multiple times before you get a response from our office. From reporting a payment to
        canceling an account, we will resolve the situation quickly and efficiently
        
        Our initial contact with the debtor will be different than other agencies. Once you’ve verbally attacked a debtor, it’s
        almost impossible to go back to a cooperative relationship. Our experienced team knows how to collect and resolve the
        debt without using intimidation and threats.
        
        Our professionalism and decades of experience are evident in our results.
