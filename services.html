            <p>At Utah Billing and Recovery Services, we specialize in medical accounts receivable.
            
            We offer a full range of services including:
            
            <a href="">Early out and Time Payment Management</a>
            
            <a href="">Collections</a>
            
            
            
            Our experienced staff understands the delicate balance of collecting medical receivables while continuing to treat your
            patients with respect.
            
            Because we have different teams that are assigned to our medical accounts, they are not managed the same as a retail
            account.
            
            We listen to what your patients are telling us, so that we may help them find the necessary resources to get the account
            paid.
            
            We also understand the differences in collecting on accounts in an urban area versus a rural location. Each and every
            patient has a different situation and different circumstances that caused the debt to begin with. Itâ€™s our job to help
            them resolve it.
            
            Our staff is highly experienced in the medical receivables industry and we offer you outstanding customer service. All
            of our staff is educated in HIPAA and the FDCPA and we take every measure to ensure the privacy of your patients
            information.
