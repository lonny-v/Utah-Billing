                <h3>Who we are!</h3>
            
            Utah Billing and Recovery Services and Evergreen Account Management are a complete and comprehensive accounts receivable
            package.
            Our entire staff is a group of highly experienced individuals who each have an average of over 20 years in billing and
            collection management. Each member of our team brings unique experiences and a greater understanding of what works and
            what doesn’t.
            We understand the need of getting you fast reimbursement for your services and giving you quality customer service,
            while at the same time, we treat your customers and patients with respect and help them find ways to resolve their
            financial obligation to you.
            We are determined to be the best agency you have ever done business with.
            
            
            <h3>What we do!</h3>
            
            At Evergreen Account Management, we offer a wide range of services of which you can build your own specific outsourcing
            package.
            
            Once the insurance has paid or denied, and for those patients who have no insurance, those self pay balances can be
            managed by our Time Payment Management division. Here we offer monthly payment plans, coupon books and follow- up on
            missed payments. Your patients will be happy with the availability to make monthly payments and your office won’t be
            faced with the uncomfortable and awkward situation of asking for payment.
            
            In every hospital, clinic and physician office, there will be patients who ignore your attempts to recover the amount
            due and those who move away or need to be pursued further. Utah Billing and Recovery Services is the collection agency
            who will take your bad debt accounts and offer a stronger approach. We have a highly skilled skip-tracing team who will
            access up to date tools, to locate those who have skipped out and verify assets once they are found. In the event legal
            action is necessary, our legal team has over 30 years experience in collecting legal accounts.
