            <p>Why EARLY OUT programs work!
            
            
            Early-Out Programs are very flexible. You have the ability to make changes quickly to free-up key employees to
            concentrate on more important areas of your business, and increase cash flow, while simultaneously reducing overhead.
            Timely and efficient collection action is the key to keeping receivables in check and avoiding the unnecessary aging of
            accounts. Too often, receivables are left sitting, waiting to be called and followed up on, because the in-house staff
            is over burdened or inexperienced. This is the worst situation possible since receivables become more uncollectible in
            proportion to their age.
            An Early-Out Program will resolve a group of accounts much faster and more efficiently than in-house staff. Payment
            plans can be customized to your specifications. Patients with serious financial situations can be handled on an
            individual basis and temporary plans can be arranged until their situation improves, thus keeping the account from
            moving into a collection status and causing the patient more financial stress.
            Patients are given payment coupon booklets for convenience and are able to set up automatic and recurring payments with
            us by using a credit card or electronic check.
            By implementing our early out program, fewer accounts go to collections which yield measurable returns as early in the
            collection process as possible.
